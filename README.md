### 📌 Featured Projects

#### 📊 Mindfulness, Cognitive Functioning, and Academic Achievement Analysis

- Conducted an extensive data analysis using **Python** on a publicly available dataset from **Rowan University**.
- Investigated the relationships between **mindfulness, stress, and academic performance** in college students.
- Applied **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical modeling (linear & quadratic regression), mediation/moderation analysis, and K-Means clustering** to uncover key insights.
- Utilized **data visualization** techniques to illustrate patterns and presented findings in a detailed report.
- Demonstrated strong skills in **data-driven decision-making, research, and statistical analysis**.

#### 📊 Extraction and Analysis of Multi-modal Dataset for Mental Disorder Detection 

- This study integrated multiple modalities—including EEG recordings from resting state and an emotional dot-probe task, behavioral performance measures, and a comprehensive set of clinical questionnaires—to investigate neurophysiological and cognitive markers associated with depression.
-  Processed the EEG data to extract features such as power spectral density, event-related potentials, and time–frequency representations, while simultaneously analyzing reaction times and accuracy from cognitive tasks.
-  By combining these neurophysiological metrics with clinical assessments that capture depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep quality, trauma history, and coping strategies, applied both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to explore differences between individuals with Major Depressive Disorder and healthy controls.
-  Advanced interpretability methods were also employed to understand feature contributions, ultimately highlighting the potential of a multi-modal, data-driven approach to enhance the objectivity and sensitivity of depression diagnosis.
